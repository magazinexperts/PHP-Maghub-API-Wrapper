# PHP-Maghub-API-Wrapper
PHP Wrapper for the Maghub API v1. Bug Reports and Pull Requests Welcome.

Simple API wrapper around most Maghub API functions. Extend this class to build off of it.


/call/index.php provides a method for calling Maghub API functions through a URL for services.
Right now this does not include any authenication, which I would recommend before using it. The easiest method might be to send the Maghub API Key and Secret via headers.
